        <p class="date">Sept. 28, 2023</p>

        <p>New Yorkers rallied in front of One Police Plaza today to demand that the city's police department fire two officers involved in the shooting death of Kawaski Trawick.</p>

        <p>About forty members representing more than a dozen community groups organized the demonstration in response to a recommendation by the police department's head of administrative trials not to discipline police officers Brendan Thompson and Herbert Davis for the shooting death of Kawaski Trawick in his Bronx apartment four years ago. </p>

        <p>"There shouldn't be a double standard for police," Trawick's parents, Ellen and Ricky, said in a statement read aloud by Justice Committee Community Safety Organizer Chauvet Bishop. "They're trained to de-escalate, but all they did with Kawaski was create a crisis when there was none."</p>

        <p>In 2019, the police department received several calls from the supportive housing facility in the Bronx where Trawick lived saying that he was harassing one of his neighbors and the superintendent. Trawick also called 911 that night, requesting help  from the fire department after locking himself from his apartment.</p>

        <p>Security camera footage and Thompson's and Herbert's body cameras show that the officers arrived after firefighters helped Trawick enter his apartment. The officers opened his apartment door, where he was standing in his kitchen with a stick and knife. Thompson tased Trawick and shot him four times, once through the heart, according to a report published by the Bronx County District Attorney on its investigation. </p>

        <p>Trawick was a 32-year-old Black and queer native of Georgia who moved to New York City shortly before his death to become a dancer.</p>

        <p>"[I'm a] proud, gay Black man," New York State Senator Jabari Brisport (D) said. "I'm also 36 [years old]. I recognize that Kawaski should've turned 37 this year."</p>

        <p>Deputy Commissioner of Administrative Trials Rosemarie Maldonado blamed the Civilian Complaint Review Board's delay in filing misconduct charges against the officers for her no-discipline decision, according to a draft ruling obtained and first reported by THE CITY last week.</p>

        <p>She said that if the CCRB met the statute of limitations deadline, which had expired just nine days prior, Maldonado would have only needed to prove Thompson's and Herbert's misconduct as police officers, not that Thompson committed a crime.</p>

        <p>"It's a play on the system by the NYPD, and it's a shame that Maldonado can't see through that," said Donovan Taveras, 24, program director for the community advocacy group El Puente. Taveras encouraged El Puente to start advocating for Trawick's case after Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark declined to press criminal charges against the officers in April.</p>

        <p>Tiffany Munro, 29, a trans justice coordinator for the Caribbean Equality Project, says she moved to New York City from Guyana around the same time Trawick was killed and has been working to hold the city's police department accountable for his death ever since.</p>

        <p>"What's with the snail pace?"" she said. "It's so heart-rending that four years have passed."</p>
